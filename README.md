#### Video Demo <>
#### Description:
Greetings , I have made myself a **Personal Finance Tracker**, which consists of several components/features that I can use and ease my organising work. They are as follows:

**PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS**: Useful for carrying out transactions whether the money is being spent or recieved. _ Branches into 2 parts, **1**. If the money is being spent, it will be added to expenses. **2** If the moeny is recieved, it will be added to the total money in the bank account._

**GATHERING DATA**: Can be used to fetch all the expenses, transactions, from the last 10 days specifically. To check the total amount being spent in those days, with briefings about whom or where it was spent on.

**BANK ACCOUNT STATUS**: To check what's the current balance in the account, the salary of the user admin, the savings he has been doing , again considering for the past 10 days.

**STORING ALL TRANSACTIONS**: It would contain all the transaction history since the account was created, all the expenses list, total money in the bank, about user's profile.
